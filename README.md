Here i am trying to build a simple password manager using python .
The code involve following functions:
  1)write_key() : it generates a cryprographic key using a python library named cryptography. and save it in  key file (key.key)
  2) load_key() :it reads the key from key file generated by the write_key().
  3)add(): it takes a input from user and add it to password.txt file in a encrypted format.
  4)view() : it reads a password.txt file decrypt the password and then display on screen.
